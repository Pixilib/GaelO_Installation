For security reason GaelO interface do not contains (yet) deletion capabalities of data.
Available "deletion" function in GaelO mark data as 'deleted' but do not really delete them to make them recoverable

If you want to make real deletion of a study you have to :

- Get stored Orthanc Series ID related to that Study and remove them from Orthanc-Pacs

SELECT `study_orthanc_id` FROM `orthanc_studies` WHERE `id_visit` IN (SELECT id_visit from visits, visit_group, visit_type WHERE visit_group.id=visit_type.group_id AND visit_type.id = visits.visit_type_id AND study="etude1")

- Manually edit the database as follow  :

Remove all specific table of the study, to list them : 
SELECT `table_review_specific` FROM `visit_type`, `visit_group` WHERE visit_group.id=visit_type.group_id AND study="etude1"
And Make DROP TABLE tableSpecificName for each table

Remove database entries in this order
DELETE FROM `reviews` WHERE `id_visit` IN (SELECT id_visit from visits, visit_type WHERE visits.visit_type_id=visit_type.id AND visit_type.group_id IN (SELECT id FROM visit_group WHERE study="STUDY"))
DELETE FROM `tracker` WHERE `id_visit` IN (SELECT id_visit from visits, visit_type WHERE visits.visit_type_id=visit_type.id AND visit_type.group_id IN (SELECT id FROM visit_group WHERE study="STUDY")) OR `study`="STUDY";
DELETE FROM `documentation` WHERE `study`="STUDY";
DELETE FROM `roles` WHERE `study`="STUDY";
DELETE FROM `orthanc_series` WHERE `study_orthanc_id` IN ( SELECT study_orthanc_id FROM orthanc_studies WHERE `id_visit` IN (SELECT id_visit from visits, visit_type WHERE visits.visit_type_id=visit_type.id AND visit_type.group_id IN (SELECT id FROM visit_group WHERE study="STUDY")) ;
DELETE FROM `orthanc_studies` WHERE `id_visit` IN (SELECT id_visit from visits, visit_type WHERE visits.visit_type_id=visit_type.id AND visit_type.group_id IN (SELECT id FROM visit_group WHERE study="STUDY"));
DELETE FROM `visits` WHERE visits.visit_type_id IN (SELECT visit_type.id FROM visit_type, visit_group WHERE visit_type.group_id = visit_group.id AND study="STUDY");
DELETE FROM `patients` WHERE `study`="STUDY";
DELETE FROM `visit_type` WHERE `group_id` IN (SELECT id from visit_group WHERE study="STUDY");
DELETE FROM `visit_group` WHERE study="STUDY";
DELETE FROM `studies` WHERE `name`="STUDY";
