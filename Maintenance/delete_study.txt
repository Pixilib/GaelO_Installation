For security reason GaelO interface do not contains (yet) deletion capabalities of data.
Available "deletion" function in GaelO mark data as 'deleted' but do not really delete them to make them recoverable

If you want to make real deletion of a study you have to :

- Get stored Orthanc Series ID related to that Study and remove them from Orthanc-Pacs

SELECT orthanc_series.series_orthanc_id FROM orthanc_series WHERE study_orthanc_id IN ( SELECT study_orthanc_id FROM orthanc_studies WHERE id_visit IN (SELECT id_visit from visits, visit_type WHERE visits.visit_type_id=visit_type.id AND visit_type.group_id IN (SELECT id FROM visit_group WHERE study="STUDY")));

- Delete Them from Orthanc Server using Delete series api

- Manually edit the database as follow  :

Remove all specific table of the study, to list them : 

SELECT @specificTables := GROUP_CONCAT(table_review_specific SEPARATOR ' , ') FROM visit_type, visit_group WHERE visit_group.id=visit_type.group_id AND study="TRAILOCLORI";
SET @sql := CONCAT('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ', @specificTables);
PREPARE stmt FROM @sql;
EXECUTE stmt;

Remove database entries in this order
DELETE FROM reviews WHERE id_visit IN (SELECT id_visit from visits, visit_type WHERE visits.visit_type_id=visit_type.id AND visit_type.group_id IN (SELECT id FROM visit_group WHERE study="STUDY"))
DELETE FROM tracker WHERE id_visit IN (SELECT id_visit from visits, visit_type WHERE visits.visit_type_id=visit_type.id AND visit_type.group_id IN (SELECT id FROM visit_group WHERE study="STUDY")) OR study="STUDY";
DELETE FROM documentation WHERE study="STUDY";
DELETE FROM roles WHERE study="STUDY";
DELETE FROM orthanc_series WHERE study_orthanc_id IN ( SELECT study_orthanc_id FROM orthanc_studies WHERE id_visit IN (SELECT id_visit from visits, visit_type WHERE visits.visit_type_id=visit_type.id AND visit_type.group_id IN (SELECT id FROM visit_group WHERE study="STUDY")));
DELETE FROM orthanc_studies WHERE id_visit IN (SELECT id_visit from visits, visit_type WHERE visits.visit_type_id=visit_type.id AND visit_type.group_id IN (SELECT id FROM visit_group WHERE study="STUDY"));
DELETE FROM visits WHERE visits.visit_type_id IN (SELECT visit_type.id FROM visit_type, visit_group WHERE visit_type.group_id = visit_group.id AND study="STUDY");
DELETE FROM patients WHERE study="STUDY";
DELETE FROM visit_type WHERE group_id IN (SELECT id from visit_group WHERE study="STUDY");
DELETE FROM visit_group WHERE study="STUDY";
DELETE FROM studies WHERE name="STUDY";
