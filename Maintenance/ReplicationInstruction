Replication of orthanc

- Transfert DICOM files using replication python script (Can be improved by multithreding uploads and deamonize it)

- Check equivalence of both servers at instance level (generate a JSON file with all instances ID, should be equals for both server once replication done)
For 800 000 instances the generated json is 10Mb so can be suitable even for large servers
curl -u username:password http://localhost:8042/instances -o instances.json
