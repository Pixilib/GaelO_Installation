Replication of orthanc

- Transfert DICOM files using replication python script (Can be improved by multithreding uploads and deamonize it)

- Check equivalence of both servers at instance level (generate a JSON file with all instances ID, should be equals for both server once replication done)
For 800 000 instances the generated json is 10Mb so can be suitable even for large servers
curl -u username:password http://localhost:8042/instances -o instances.json

-Replication of Docker Volumes
Use a Ubuntu container in which the volume to save is mounted, map a container folder to host folder and generate the tar of the folder to save
Here is a backup of OrthancIndex
docker run --rm --volumes-from indexorthanc -v ~/backup:/backup ubuntu tar cvf /backup/backup.tar /var/lib/mysql

--Resaure volume (to be tested)
docker run --rm --volumes-from indexorthanc -v $(pwd):/backup ubuntu bash -c "cd /var/lib/mysql && tar xvf /backup/backup.tar --strip 1"
